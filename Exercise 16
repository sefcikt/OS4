 16. Write a program that will simulate FCFS, SJN, SRT, and Round Robin
 scheduling algorithms. For each algorithm, the program should compute
 waiting time and turn around time of every job as well as the average waiting
time and average turn around time. The average values should be consolidated
in a table for easy comparison. You may use the following data to test your
program. The time quantum for Round Robin is 4 ms. (Assume that the
 context switching time is 0).
